# Unofficial-Bruker-AFM-Automated-Program-Grid-Definer
This script creates a GUI which lets you modify a grid of points in the XY coordinate plane, then output the result to a Bruker AFM automated program file. The intent of this program is to save users time in defining the automated program when defining particularly high sample number measurements.

To-do: 
-Add buttons to shift the origin to any of the 4 corners of the grid, or placed at the center
-Add a random sampling mode
